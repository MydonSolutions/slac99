# slac99
A meson compiled C shared library for the SLALIB Fortran routines.

The original Fortran routines are attributed to Patrick T. Wallace ([2014ascl.soft03025W](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ascl.soft03025W/abstract)), and are cloned in the [pyslalib](https://github.com/MydonSolutions/pyslalib) subproject, which selects the files from the [Starlink](https://github.com/Starlink/starlink/tree/master/libraries/sla) project.
